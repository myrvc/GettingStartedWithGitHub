# GitHub Developer Program
In 2014, I became a GitHub developer.  As a developer you get access to all GitHub APIâ€™s along with access to keynotes, collaboration sessions and integration examples of GitHub in iOT, web development, most coding languages and even more.  

I encourage all my students to become a GitHub developer after using GitHub for a few months or after creating at least 25 repositories.

# GitHub Classroom
I have used this for coding workshops and at least two lessons a semester in each of my programming courses. It allows you to take an existing GitHub Organization, Assign a classname and begin adding assignments. You have the ability with this to have students start with a base project or from scratch.
