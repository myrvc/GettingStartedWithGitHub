# Integrate GitHub into Visual Studio
I create a new podcast each semester showing students how to integrate GitHub into Visual Studio.
See GitHub extension for Visual Studio  https://visualstudio.github.com/
The reason a new podcast has to be created each semester is due to the ever changing Visual Studio environment.

# Show Students how to Create, Manage and Update GitHub Repositories
In addition, I create another podcast on how to merge and commit their first repository.

# GitHub Organizations
I use GitHub organizations to connect all of their personal GitHub accounts and have them add me as a contributor to all of their repos.
 
# Submitting Assignments
I have students submit their GitHub Repository URL each week in lieu of uploading project files in Eagle.
